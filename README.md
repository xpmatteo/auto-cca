# AI things to try

- make dice rolling in AI deterministic
- reduce iterations when the choice is for battle or retreat
- (make close combat not optional?  or increase the reward for it?)

# TODO


- evasion
- "if you don't have any X unit, order a unit of your choice"
- advance after combat
- ranged combat line of sight restriction
- cavalry, chariot battle again after advance
- more cards
- leaders
- terrain
- heavy chariot battles back with 3 dice not 4
- heavy chariot ignores one sword result
