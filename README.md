# TODO

- out of memory?
- too slow

- advance after combat
- battle again after advance
- ranged combat line of sight restriction
- order light units: can move through friendly units
- flags > 1 should retreat > 1
- support should let you ignore only 1 flags not all
- movement of 3 or 4 hexes
- evasion
- more cards
- leaders
- terrain
- heavy chariot battles back with 3 dice not 4
- heavy chariot ignores one sword result

# AI things to try

 - if # of visits is same, choose the one with best score
 - hashing MCTS states?
 - optimize neighbors
