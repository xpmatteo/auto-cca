# TODO

  - implement at least simplified version of support rule (ignore all flags)
  - shorter playouts
  - chance nodes should simulate average results



  - correct behaviour for combat result with more than 1 flag
  - battle back can result in a retreat too
  - light infantry should not hit on swords
  - light infantry can evade
  - ranged combat
  - move selection is too broad; random playout do not convey enough information
    - TRY an evaluation function for the playouts?
