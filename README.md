# TODO

- out of memory?
- too slow

- "if you don't have any X unit, order a unit of your choice"
- advance after combat
- ranged combat line of sight restriction
- flags > 1 should retreat > 1
- support should let you ignore only 1 flags not all
- evasion
- cavalry, chariot battle again after advance
- more cards
- leaders
- terrain
- heavy chariot battles back with 3 dice not 4
- heavy chariot ignores one sword result

- if all eligible units can be ordered, they should be ordered automatically

# AI things to try

- ranged combat should always be preferable to ending the phase early
- 
- if # of visits is same, choose the one with best score
- hashing MCTS states?
